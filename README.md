## **Getting Started**
### **For Users**  
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](#) page.  
2. Flash the OS onto your device using the included installer.  
3. Reboot your device and follow the onboarding process.  

### **For Developers**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoxuOS/Noxu.git
   ```
2. Install build dependencies (see Build Guide).
3. Compile the kernel and deploy to supported hardware or virtual machine.
4. Contribute by creating new AI models or optimizing system components.

### **Agent Workflow Prototype**
NoxuOS includes a runnable multi-agent prototype in `agent-workflow-app`. It wires together a Writer agent and Reviewer agent with a mock provider by default, and can use OpenAI when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured.

```powershell
cd agent-workflow-app
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

### **Loading Ollama Models On Pi Or Kali**
Use `tools/bootstrap-ollama-node.sh` on Linux nodes to install Ollama, start it locally, pull models, and configure `agent-workflow-app/.env`.

Pi 5 lightweight model host:

```bash
cd ~/NoxuOS
git pull
./tools/bootstrap-ollama-node.sh pi
```

Kali security node:

```bash
cd ~/NoxuOS
git pull
PI_ADDRESS=192.168.1.243 ./tools/bootstrap-ollama-node.sh kali
```

Override model choices when needed:

```bash
MODELS="llama3.2:latest" ./tools/bootstrap-ollama-node.sh pi
MODELS="llama3.2:latest qwen2.5:7b" PI_ADDRESS=192.168.1.243 ./tools/bootstrap-ollama-node.sh kali
```

The script keeps Ollama local to each node at `127.0.0.1:11434`. It does not expose Windows Ollama to the LAN.

After bootstrapping the Linux nodes, verify the fleet from Windows:

```powershell
cd agent-workflow-app
npm run fleet:check
```

For connectivity-only checks while models are still downloading:

```powershell
$env:FLEET_REQUIRE_MODELS="false"; npm run fleet:check; Remove-Item Env:FLEET_REQUIRE_MODELS
```

## **How It Works**
AI Kernel: Manages system resources, user interactions, and parallel task execution efficiently.
Task Manager: Instead of apps, tasks are directly assigned to the OS, e.g., “Prepare a presentation” or “Check emails.”
Gaming Engine: Supports direct integration of AAA mobile and PC games for native play.

## **Roadmap**
### **v0.1 (Pre-Alpha):**
Initial AI kernel development.
Basic task management and interaction.
### **v0.2 (Alpha):**
Support for hybrid on-device/cloud AI processing.
Experimental gaming support.
### **v1.0 (Beta):**
Fully functional AI-driven OS with multi-tasking, gaming, and customization.
